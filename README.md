# Forecasting-exchange-rates-with-VIX

This is a group project I worked on for my **Economic and Financial Forecasting** class with classmates Anisah ARZ, Arya Ravi and Lim Fang Yi. We used the methods of forecasting, model selection and forecast evaluation  we learnt in class to predict exchange rates using the volatility indicator - VIX. Our model is a modification of the Taylor's Rule. We incorporated the lags of VIX as an additional predictor and compared our results against the original model. Our Stata code, report and presentation slides are included in the repository.
